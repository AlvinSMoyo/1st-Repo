# Happy Customers Project at Apziva

## 📝 Project Overview

The **Happy Customers Project**, developed during my time at **Apziva**, focuses on analyzing customer feedback to assess satisfaction levels and uncover opportunities for improving user experience.  
Using **data preprocessing**, **natural language processing (NLP)**, and **data visualization**, the project aims to extract actionable insights from raw feedback data and drive data-informed decisions.

## 🔄 Project Workflow

The project was executed in clearly defined stages:

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Gathered and explored customer feedback datasets from multiple sources.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Cleaned data by handling null values, standardizing text, and formatting entries for analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Identified trends and anomalies using visual and statistical techniques.

4. **Sentiment Analysis**  
   - Applied NLP tools (like TextBlob/VADER/spaCy) to classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.

5. **Data Visualization**  
   - Built clear and compelling visualizations to highlight key trends and insights using tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

6. **Reporting and Recommendations**  
   - Summarized insights and offered strategic recommendations to improve customer satisfaction and retention.
